# Considerations
- Developed by Jacob Willbanks for CMPS 2680 at California State University of Bakersfield (2018)
- Utilizes the P5.js framework by Lauren McCarthy (https://p5js.org/)
- Movie Poster CSS (https://codepen.io/quentinver/pen/MXZBpb)
- **Most web browsers block local file sharing now as of 2021, which is what was utilized in these projects for image asset loading. Changing IMG tags in js files to a p5.js geometric syntax such as rect() or uploading the files to a local server and changing any loadimage() file path in any .js file should fix assest loading errors.**
