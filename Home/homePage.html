                                Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. Nokia Phones had a variant of Snake in 1998. <br> - Wikipedia

                                 A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. The word is used to refer both to branching tour puzzles through which the solver must find a route, and to simpler non-branching ("unicursal") patterns that lead unambiguously through a convoluted layout to a goal. (The term "labyrinth" is generally synonymous with "maze", but can also connote specifically a unicursal pattern.) <br> - Wikipedia

                                    Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen (Nguyễn Hà Đông), under his game development company dotGEARS. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. Nguyen created the game over the period of several days, using a bird protagonist which he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012. <br> - Wikipedia
